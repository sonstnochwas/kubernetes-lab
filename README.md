# My "Play with Kubernetes" Home Lab

> This repository documents the installation and configuration. 

## What's the plan?

Install a Kubernetes cluster (single server) for tinkering at home on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3.

Later on I will - eventually - switch to NixOS (see Issue #1), to 
ease system rescue :-)
But first I want to understand the installation/configuration itself.

## Status

Nothing in this repository is final, tested or usable at the current state.
As things are progressing, the documentation will be updated accordingly.

## *"The Project"*

This repository is part of *The Project* which involves a Kubernetes cluster (here), a deployments/microservice in different programming languages and automated pipelines, which will be cross referenced.

This project is for personal development and may help others.

As the DevOps ecosystem is still evolving very fast, this project unfortunately lacks an essential feature of projects: a fixed end.
Nevertheless, we stick to the name ...
