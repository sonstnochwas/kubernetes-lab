# Install operatig system (RHEL8.3)

## Why RHEL?

- The author feels more comfortable with Fedora/Centos/RHEL than Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
- Fedora support livecycle too short
- Centos 8 is depricated and Centos stream feels not done, yet
- RHEL is free with developer account (see [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/new-year-new-red-hat-enterprise-linux-programs-easier-ways-access-rhel))
